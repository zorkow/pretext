<div class="para">Labels are treated distinctly to structural components of the diagram should they contain mathematical formulas. While they can be manually described by the author by providing a dedicated annotation element, we also exploit the fact that they are rendered with MathJax, which can provide accessibility support via the Speech Rule Engine <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sre.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 10">[10]</a>. This means that formulas are rendered as SVG with an attached aria-label containing a corresponding speech string — which can be localised or given in Braille. At the moment we only expose the top-most aria-label as an alternative to the manual description if one is given. However, SRE can also embed speech deeply into the rendered formula, with one speech string per subexpression, together with a navigation structure based on a semantic interpretation of the formula. This feature can be useful for more complex formulas as the differential equation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_examples.html" title="Figure 1.1">Figure 1.1</a>. We aim to integrate this as a future feature.</div>
