<div class="para">The annotations that accompany our example diagram are given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_Annotations.html" title="Listing 2.2">Listing 2.2</a>. Note how the ids of the annotations either refer to element ids in the diagram specification or to standard names of elements such as grid and axes. The annotations define the layers of detail for the diagram, which can be arbitrarily deep. In the example we have a nesting depth of three: The top-most annotation provides a summary of the figure, followed by the description of the tangent graph. The latter is again broken down into the three component of graph, tangent line and tangent point, which reflect the drawn elements in the diagram as specified in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_xml.html" title="Listing 2.1">Listing 2.1</a>. We see that description for the other the main components, the axes and the grid are not explicitly given. Those will be programmatically generated and included automatically. They could, however, be overwritten manually.</div>
