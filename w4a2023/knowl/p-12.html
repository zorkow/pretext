<div class="para">Annotations are included separately from the graphical descriptions since the order in which elements are drawn may differ from how they are traversed in a screen reader. The set of annotations forms a hierarchical structure that begins with a global description of the diagram and proceeds inward by nesting annotations to examine graphical elements in greater detail. This provides the basic interaction model that we use to allow readers to explore the diagram in detail, as we will discuss in the next section. Many common elements are annotated automatically, leading to a standardised user experience for VI learners—or authors inspecting the diagram during the creation process—when screen reading, exploring or sonifying a diagram. Nevertheless authors can also provide bespoke manual annotations directly.</div>
