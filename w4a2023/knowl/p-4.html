<div class="para">Our goal is to enable all authors to generate accessible mathematical diagrams easily by creating a high-level description of the mathematical components of the diagram using a provided language with a relatively small, but intuitive, vocabulary. And in particular we want to support VI authors by reducing the inspection cycles by offering a simpler, XML-based language that automates many routine tasks, such as drawing grids and placing labels, while still providing the flexibility to handle unusual situations. Resulting SVG graphics are made accessible with the diagcess libraryÂ <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/w4a2015.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 11">[11]</a><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/icchp18.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4">[4]</a>, which was initially designed for the generation of accessible chemical diagrams. The library allows readers to interactively engage with the created diagrams by exploring them step-wise and on different layers, enabling aural rendering and sonfication.</div>
