<div class="para">Our work is based in the context of PreTeXt, a tool that facilitates the creation of accessible scholarly documents. A PreTeXt author describes the structure of their document in XML while keeping the mathematical content in standard <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>. Thus, similar to <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>, documents are written without concern for their visual appearance while authoring, and PreTeXt will create an accessible version of the document in a variety of formats, such as HTML, PDF, ePub, or Braille. Our graphical authoring langugage is designed in a similar spirit and will eventually allow PreTeXt authors the ability to create accessible graphics directly in their documents. Some examples of diagrams that can be generated and made accessible with our technique are presented in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_examples.html" title="Figure 1.1">FigureÂ 1.1</a>. We will use the top left-most as a running example.</div>
