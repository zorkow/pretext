<div class="para">We have presented a novel language for specifying accessible mathematics diagrams that allows for the automatic generation of accessible graphical content. And while its main purpose is to support VI authors in creating their own graphical content, the language design should also appeal to the general scientific community to easily draw and annotate graphics for their publications. And with the use of PreTeXt becoming more common the hope is that more and more scientific graphics will be born accessible in the future. Although our initial experience with the language is positive, we still need to experiment in detail with the vocabulary to ensure that it is fit for purpose. On the other hand we have user tested our navigation model in a number of projects and are confident that it is helpful. Features that we aim to add in the near future are to allow the exploration of complex equations in more depth with MathJax as well as to provide sonfication of groups of curves by using multiple frequencies.</div>
